# merge_pdfs
A Python Script to merge all .pdf files in a supplied directory and save them to an output file.

## To-Do (some stuff that I could do)
- Verify the pdf file about to be merged is a pdf file
- Migrate the print of "Attempting to merge files" block
- Create some functions and a proper main()
